## Getting Started

This is a custom activity feed modeled after Notion and the [Knock JavaScript SDK](https://docs.knock.app/sdks/javascript/quick-start). It's purpose is to show you how to build custom feed implementations using other UI libraries or your own design system. This example uses Next.js and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
